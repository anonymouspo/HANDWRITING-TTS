# HANDWRITING-TTS
Work Sample of Handwriting Recognition 

This is a small project on recognizing texts and converting them to audio. This is limited to Handwritten texts, as they require complex pre-processing compared to OCR alternative.
This model uses a CRNN based model. Application of such systems are endless.Few are listed below:
  1) Can benefit Visually impaired, especially when literature/text is not in Braille
  2) Remote Teaching can be made feasible , with handrwitten notes and a voice explaining the text.
  3) Handwritten transcripts of meetings,gatherings can be easily digitalized and stored.
  
## Sample Input

Ofcourse, accuracy can be improved by tuning the hyperparameters and tweaking lines of code. The model tries to segment the paragraph into individual words and then, recognition is done on these individual words.
The model was trained on IAM Dataset. Training Model notebook can be used for training the model with required parameters and epochs.
